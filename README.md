The user may then click on any of the movies that they may find interesting or have opinions on. They will then be directed to that movies feed in which they will be able to view and leave comments on posts that other users have published. A user can also go to 'creat new post' and upload their own thoughts, they have space for a title, content, and even be able to upload a .png file to go with their thoughts.
