  ## Usage
  A user may visit the website and either register if it's their first time, or login if they are already apart of the community, they can then view the home page and scroll through 20 of the upcoming movies that are releasing. The user may then click on any of the movies that they may find interesting or have opinions on. They will then be directed to that movies feed in which they will be able to view and leave comments on posts that other users have published. A user can also go to 'creat new post' and upload their own thoughts, they have space for a title, content, and even be able to upload a .png file to go with their thoughts. This post may be edited or deleted later by the user. Each user will also have their own dashboard where they can view all the posts they have created.
